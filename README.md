# Robot AIT
This is a service robot setup developed by Automation and IT, TH Koeln. The objective of the robot is to travel in through an indoor map and bring desired objects from a predefined location(on the table). It uses gmapping (SLAM) for mapping and move_base for navigation. The object_recognition_kitchen package is used for object detection. 
The Arduino acts as a bridge between ROS and the motor controls. An IMU (MPU9250) is also added for improved localization. The Motor RPM and Orientation nodes are published from the Arduino. For mapping, mapping_bot.launch file is executed which chains through the relevant driver and slam launch files. For navigating the bot simply navigate_bot.launch file is executed. The object detection using linemod works pretty well for detecting various shapes present in the environment.
Future work includes incorporation of the Robot Arm (as can be seen from robot_full_design.stl file and use MoveIT for kinematics and motion planning.
The Arduino source code is in the robot_ait_arduino directory. The ROS launch files, YAML files for navigation stack and base_controler files can be found in the robot_ait folder.
